--- Immutable map.
--- This object is an unsorted list of (String, a). When a old key is
--- reassigned, a new entry is added in a new 'Map'.
--- Functions 'pack' and 'delete' also creates new 'Map's.

--- Adds a pair key-value. If key already exists, the former one is not deleted

--- Removes key

--- Removes former duplicate keys.
